### Magic Home / flux_led

This is a utility for controlling stand-alone Magic Home devices manufactured by [Zengge](http://www.zengge.com/sy).
The protocol was reverse-engineered by studying packet captures between a 
bulb and the controlling "Magic Home" mobile app.  The code here dealing 
with the network protocol is littered with magic numbers, and ain't so pretty.
But it does seem to work!

So far most of the functionality of the apps is available here via the CLI
and/or programmatically.

The classes in this project could very easily be used as an API, and incorporated into a GUI app written 
in PyQt, Kivy, or some other framework.

#### Minimum python version

3.7

##### Available:
* Discovering bulbs on LAN
* Turning on/off bulb
* Get state information
* Setting "warm white" mode
* Setting single color mode
* Setting preset pattern mode
* Setting custom pattern mode
* Reading timers
* Setting timers
* Sync clock
* Music Mode for devices with a built-in microphone (asyncio version only)
* Remote access administration (asyncio version only)
* Device configuration including wiring order, ic type, pixels, etc (asyncio version only)
	
##### Some missing pieces:
* Initial administration to set up WiFi SSID and passphrase/key.
	  
##### Cool feature:
* Specify colors with names or web hex values.  Requires that python "webcolors" 
package is installed.  (Easily done via pip, easy_install, or apt-get, etc.) Use --listcolors to show valid color names.

##### Installation:
* Flux_led package available at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flux-led/
```
pip install flux_led
```

##### Examples:
```
Scan network:
	flux_led -s

Scan network and show info about all:
	flux_led -sSti

Turn on:
	flux_led 192.168.1.100 --on
	flux_led 192.168.1.100 -192.168.1.101 -1

Turn on all bulbs on LAN:
	flux_led -sS --on

Turn off:
	flux_led 192.168.1.100 --off
	flux_led 192.168.1.100 --0
	flux_led -sS --off
	
Set warm white, 75%
	flux_led 192.168.1.100 -w 75 -1

Set fixed color red :
	flux_led 192.168.1.100 -c Red
	flux_led 192.168.1.100 -c 255,0,0
	flux_led 192.168.1.100 -c "#FF0000"
	
Set preset pattern #35 with 40% speed:	
	flux_led 192.168.1.100 -p 35 40
	
Set custom pattern 25% speed, red/green/blue, gradual change:
	flux_led 192.168.1.100 -C gradual 25 "red green (0,0,255)"

Sync all bulb's clocks with this computer's:
	flux_led -sS --setclock
		
Set timer #1 to turn on red at 5:30pm on weekdays:
	flux_led 192.168.1.100 -T 1 color "time:1730;repeat:12345;color:red"
	
Deactivate timer #4:
	flux_led 192.168.1.100 -T 4 inactive ""

Use --timerhelp for more details on setting timers
```
	
##### Show help:
```
